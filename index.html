                <p>In recent years, fashion in South Korea has evolved due to inspirations from Western culture, wealth, and social media practices as well as the country's developing economy.</p>
                <p>Despite these influences, South Korean fashion has maintained a unique style which has influenced worldwide trends. South Korea's style is known for being expressive and reflecting a sense of individuality. </p>
                <p>Among post-Soviet states, it is in Kazakhstan that Korean fashion is most popular. Korean fashion over the years of our country's independence has managed to make adjustments to the notions of fashion and style in Kazakh society. This can be seen by most popular brands like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qazaq.republic/?hl=ru" target="blank">Qazaq Republic</a>. If you study Korean fashion in depth, you may notice a lot of elements which are in Kazakhstan fashion at the moment.</p>

                    <li>1917–1919: Textile industry opens; Joseon Textile Corporation and Kangsung Textiles are established and a labor-intensive industry with inexpensive workforce begins.</li>
                    <li>1960: Labor-intensive industry changes when the first mass-producing corporations appear.</li>
                    <li>1970: Beginning of the women's clothing industry; minority designers make female ready-made suits in small boutiques.</li>
                    <li>1972–1977: Major companies participate in making ready-made clothes (there is an automatic increase in the quality of clothing).</li>
                    <li>After 1970s: Because of increased GNP and the social debut of women, more diverse women's clothing begins to appear.</li>
                    <li>1980–1982: Advent of color TV; school uniform and hairstyle regulations impact fashion in South Korea.</li>
                    <li>1986–1988: Hosting of Asian Games and 1988 Summer Olympics increases development of sport clothing brands.</li>
                    <li>1997: Fashion industry declines in the IMF.</li>
                    <li>1999: Fashion industry recovers (high class materials with famous brands increasingly noticeable).</li>
                    <li>Present: Government support and public attention leads to growth of designer fashion; Korean fashion industry is establishing its position in the world.</li>

            <h2><strong>Korean Wave</strong></h2>
                <p>The Korean wave is the rise in global popularity of South Korean culture since 1990. At that time, it was caused by the spread of Korean doramas and K-pop and now the spread of Korean fashion in global culture.</p>

                <p>Due to the Korean wave in many countries around the world, the number of Korean fashion shows began to grow arithmetically.  And in some regions, like the Middle East, Korean-style fashion shows were held for the first time.</p>

                <p>Chang Kwang-Hyo is one of Korea's most famous designers and has been designing menswear for over thirty years. When he decided to devote himself to fashion in the late 1970s, in his homeland only women were designing clothes, and male ready-to-wear did not yet exist. In 1994 he was the first of his compatriots to show a collection in Paris and earned the nickname "The Oriental Jean Paul Gaultier".</p>

                <p>Myoung Yoo-suk, a professor at the prestigious Konkuk University, specialises in traditional costume. However, the renowned craftsman's collections are very far from museum specimens. It is a modern take on European cut, which can be worked with indefinitely. The designer uses malleable costume fabrics which are easy to drape.</p>

                <h2>Trends</h2>
                <p>Korean style is nourished by numerous undercurrents stemming from the national costume tradition, street subcultures and the infiltration of European fashion. All together form a surprising and distinctive swirl of colours, silhouettes and proportions.</p>

                <strong>Mini</strong>
                <p>It is common among Korean fashionistas. Skirts, shorts or dresses are often just below hip length. However, they compensate for this lack of length with voluminous and layered tops.</p>

                <strong>Oversize</strong>
                <p>A favoured trend, which can also be seen in supermodels, is the deliberate 'stretchy' cardigans and oversized hoodies. This trend is especially true of outerwear - in Korean style, it's rare to see a tightly buttoned trench coat, because even in eccentric streetwear, Koreans prefer comfort.</p>
                <img src="https://officiel.devmaster.facility.team/images/news/aeac4/e296a/7e73c8e0e3b.jpg" class="Big">

                <strong>Bourgeois chic</strong>
                <p>Finally, a fusion of business, sporty and classic fashion is popular among Korean Influencers. On the streets of Seoul, for example, you can find a girl wearing a voluminous parka over a pantsuit or a checkered blazer with a strict white collar and aristocratic 30s hairstyle. This is a case where Korean fashion has grinded down the extensively European fashion in its millstones and created a unique hybrid style.</p>
